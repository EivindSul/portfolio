# Portfolio
This is a collection of work that I have done throughout my studies, as well as in my spare time.

## Private projects
Intbar bonger is a project to create simple coupons for pre-paid drinks at the
par I worked at.  The coupons have a set of requirements of how to customize them,
including price and expiration.  This program replaces an older similar system
made by a previous student using Java, but that program was impossible to
maintain. I focused on making my version easily maintainable and extensible.

## Projects from studies

### INF101 - Object oriented programming
This course taught me the basics of object-oriented programming and design using
Java. The two repos below are the main semester assignments that I completed.

- [Blob wars](https://github.com/EivindSul/inf101-blobwars)

### INF112 - Software development
This course taught teamwork, version control, and software design. It also
taught us test-driven development and how to work using agile principles.  We
leart throughout the project, so it became victim of numerous large refactors.
It was still a fun and educational project.
